    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "Explore the dataset to identify differences between the customers of each product. You can also explore relationships between the different attributes of the customers. You can approach it from any other line of questioning that you feel could be relevant for the business. The idea is to get you comfortable working in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps:**\n",
    "1. Come up with a customer profile (characteristics of a customer) of the different products\n",
    "2. Perform univariate and multivariate analyses\n",
    "3. Generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the company in targeting new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Questions:**\n",
    "I would like to study the correlation between the treadmill model and the other columns in the dataset. To do that, my key question will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are there some correlation between the numerics (Age, Education, Usage, Fitness, Income, Miles) columns and the product name?\n",
    "2. What is the group of age of the customer that bought more products? it will be used to determine what model I can offer to the new customer depending on his/her age.\n",
    "3. What is marital status of the customer that bought more products? it will be used to determine what model I can offer to the new customer depending on his/her marital status.\n",
    "4. What is the high level education of the customer that bought more products?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Description:**\n",
    "The data is about customers of the treadmill product(s) of a retail store called Cardio Good Fitness. It contains the following variables\n",
    "\n",
    "* Product: The model no. of the treadmill\n",
    "* Age: Age of the customer in no of years\n",
    "* Gender: Gender of the customer\n",
    "* Education: Education of the customer in no. of years\n",
    "* Marital Status: Marital status of the customer\n",
    "* Usage: Avg. # times the customer wants to use the treadmill every week\n",
    "* Fitness: Self rated fitness score of the customer (5 - very fit, 1 - very unfit\n",
    "* Income: Income of the customer\n",
    "* Miles: Miles that a customer expects to run"

    "- Older people, who have better incomes, are the ones who are buying the TM798 product, apparently, they find it more appealing, perhaps because it costs more and they can afford it. Due to this, if the company wants to position this product among young people, it must carry out a marketing strategy that focuses on the product. Additionally, a cost strategy for this product should be reviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- According to the information analysed, married people with more experience, especially men, are the ones who invest the most in the TM798 product. If you want women to see this product in a more attractive way, you should review a cost and marketing strategy that allows you to reach them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is necessary to promote the sale of the other products TM498 and TM798 within the current average age range. Although it is true that the TM195 is the product that is currently bought by both women and men alike, the TM498 and TM798 should start to be marketed. We must create a positioning campaign for these products so that they can reach the average number of people who buy in the store."
